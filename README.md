# Craps Casino Game

# A popular dice game

The rules A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces. These faces contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 spots. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins (this is called a “Natural win”). If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw (called "craps"), the player loses (i.e. the "house" wins). If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, then the sum becomes the player's "point." To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you "make your point." The player loses by rolling a 7 before making the point.
